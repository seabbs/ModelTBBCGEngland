Plot number of cases detected each year, stratified by age group:
Using a minimum of 16 particles based on the number of particles specified.
Using a maximum of 64 particles based on the minimum number of particles times by 4.
Load the model as a compiled libbi object
Adapting proposal with a min acceptance of 0.1 and a maximum acceptance of 0.2
Running for 5 iterations with 100 samples each time.
