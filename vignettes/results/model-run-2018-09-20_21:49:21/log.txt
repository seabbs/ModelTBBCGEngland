Using 11 particles based on the number of observed data samples (rounded to the nearest multiple of 4).
Using a minimum of 11 particles based on the number of observed data samples (rounded to the nearest multiple of 4).
Using a maximum of 44 particles based on the minimum number of particles times by 4.
