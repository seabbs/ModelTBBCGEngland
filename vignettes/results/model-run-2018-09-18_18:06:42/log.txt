Plot number of cases detected each year:
Saving 7 x 7 in image
Plot number of cases detected each year, stratified by age group:
Using 23 particles based on the number of observed data samples.
Using a minimum of 12 particles based on the number of observed data samples divided by two.
Using a maximum of 48 particles based on the minimum number of particles times by 4.
