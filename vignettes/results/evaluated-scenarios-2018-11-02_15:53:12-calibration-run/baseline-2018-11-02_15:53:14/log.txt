Plot number of cases detected each year, stratified by age group:
Using 4 particles based on the number of observed data samples (rounded to the nearest power of 2).
Using a minimum of 4 particles based on the number of particles specified.
Using a maximum of 16 particles based on the minimum number of particles times by 4.
