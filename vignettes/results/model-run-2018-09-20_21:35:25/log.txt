Plot number of cases detected each year, stratified by age group:
geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?

Using 10 particles based on the number of observed data samples (rounded to the nearest multiple of 4).
Using a minimum of 10 particles based on the number of observed data samples (rounded to the nearest multiple of 4).
Using a maximum of 40 particles based on the minimum number of particles times by 4.
Load the model as a compiled libbi object
Adapting particles starting with 10 up to a maximum of 40
Adapting particles iteration: 1
Initial sampling using the prior as the proposal.
