Plot number of cases detected each year, stratified by age group:
Using 4 particles based on the number of observed data samples (rounded to the nearest power of 2).
Using a minimum of 4 particles based on the number of particles specified.
Using a maximum of 16 particles based on the minimum number of particles times by 4.

Optimising the deterministic model
Taking a 100 samples from the posterior to estimate
              the acceptance rate as proposal adaption has not been run.
Acceptance rate of 0.005005005005005 after adapting the proposal
Using 20 rejuvernation moves in order to target at least a 10% acceptence rate for each rejuvernation sample.
