Plot number of cases detected each year, stratified by age group:
Saving 7 x 7 in image
Using 39 particles based on the number of observed data samples.
Using a minimum of 20 particles based on the number of observed data samples divided by two.
Using a maximum of 80 particles based on the minimum number of particles times by 4.
